* Python tool chain

#####Python tool chain
* PyBuilder
PyBuilder is a multi-purpose software build tool. Most commonly it targets the building and management of software with a strong focus on Python.
* PyInstaller
PyInstaller is a program that freezes (packages) Python programs into stand-alone executables, under Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, Solaris and AIX. 
* [Unit test frameworks](http://pythontesting.net)
Including Nose, doctest, unittest, pytest.
* Coverage
Coverage.py is a tool for measuring code coverage of Python programs. It monitors your program, noting which parts of the code have been executed, then analyzes the source to identify code that could have been executed but was not.
* [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/)
Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation. It was originally created for the new Python documentation, and it has excellent facilities for the documentation of Python projects, but C/C++ is already supported as well, and it is planned to add special support for other languages as well. 

#####Git
* .gitignore
Automaticly generating [.gitignore](www.gitignore.io)
